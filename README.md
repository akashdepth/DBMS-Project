# DBMS-Project
Project 9.17(Book Henry F Korth):   Design and implement a Web-based multiuser calendar system. The system must track appointments for each person, including multioccurrence events, such as weekly meetings, and shared events (where an update made by the event creator gets reflected to all those who share the event). Provide interfaces to schedule multiuser events, where an event creator can add a number of users who are invited to the event. Provide email notification of events. For extra credits implement a Web service that can be used by a reminder program running on the client machine.
